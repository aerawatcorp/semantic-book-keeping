# semantic-book-keeping
Simple Book Keeping (Accounting) using normal human semantics.

## philosophy
Book Keeping should be as easier as we write down to remember any financial matters.

I have always loved the idea of semantic and human language driven input system to define machine readable content. This can be implemented in task journals, expenses tracking, even in project management in the future.

Later the experience can be improved with better natural language learning models, however we can simply solve by simple lexical parsing also. 

## idea
write now, analyse later

## approach
simple human-like syntax to depict daily transactions.

## example
@myself paid @my_wife 10000 for some reasons (tokens : myself, paid, wife, 10000, some-reasons)
@myself received from @some_friend Rs 10000 for short term (tokens: myself, received, some_friend, 10000, short term)
